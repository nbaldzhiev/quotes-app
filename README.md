A simple React app, hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://nbaldzhiev.github.io/quotes-app/), to practice React, HTML, and CSS The website's sole purpose is to practice FE development. The React app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This project is used to practice React. It allows for getting a random quote with or without a category specified. The API utilised for the quotes is [quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).

The app allows:
* getting a random quote without specifying a quote category;
* getting a random quote within a specified category - you first select the category and then use the button for fetching a quote within this category;
* opening the Wikipedia page of the author by clicking on the author's name link;
* getting short bio information about the author by hovering over the author's name.

The website is somewhat responsive with a single breakpoint at max-width 768px to allow for better rendering on smartphones.
